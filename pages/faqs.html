                <!-- question -->
                <h1 class="faq-page">Hardtail vs Full Suspension</h1>
                <!-- answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <!-- Hardtail Pros & Cons -->
                    <p><span class="bold">Hardtail – Bike with a rigid frame and a suspension fork</span></p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li class="multi-paragraph">Pros</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p class="multi-paragraph">Cheaper – This should be obvious, but you can typically get a nicer hardtail for a lot less money than a full-suspension bike. Solid hardtails start around $800-$1000 and you can get an extremely capable hardtail for less than $2000</p></li>
                                <li><p>Simpler/Less Maintenance – On a full suspension bike you need to worry about a rear shock, pivots, linkages, bearings, etc in addition to every other component on the bike. That is clearly not the case on a hardtail. This drastically reduced the costs of ownership and time spent tinkering on your bike.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Lighter – Due to less mechanical components and overall simpler design, hardtails are typically lighter when equipped with similar components.</p></li>
                                <li><p>More efficient – Although full suspensions are getting better all the time, some pedaling power is lost in the suspension compressing with each pedal stroke. On a hardtail, outside of a small amount of energy being lost in compressing the front fork almost all power is transmitted into the drivetrain and thus the wheels.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Some argue that a hardtail can teach better riding skills as you can’t rely on the rear suspension to bail you out of mistakes. Line choice is more crucial on a hardtail.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="multi-paragraph">Cons</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p class="multi-paragraph">Arguably less capable</p></li>
                                <li><p>Can be harder on your body and more fatiguing</p></li>
                                <li><p>Less traction over rough terrain</p></li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>

    
                    <!-- Full Suspension Pros & Cons -->
                    <p class="multi-paragraph"><span class="bold">Full-Suspension - bike with suspension for the rear wheel as well as a suspension fork for the front.</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="multi-paragraph">Pros</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Improved control and more capable – The addition of rear suspension can give you lots of confidence carrying speed through technical trails and features. This also gives you a more forgiving ride</p></li>
                                <li><p>Better traction and potentially more efficient over rough terrain – Suspension allows the bike to stay in better contact with the ground which gives you a better grip and control in both climbing and descending. A common myth is that a full-suspension bike doesn't climb as well as a hardtail. This isn’t entirely true and often depends on the terrain. Sure, on a fire road or smooth climb the hardtail will likely be better, but if it’s a rough or techy climb the added traction can help dramatically.</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="multi-paragraph">Cons</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Higher initial cost</p></li>
                                <li><p>Higher long term cost with maintenance and more things to go wrong.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Heavier when equipped with similar components</p></li>

            <div class="faq-three">
                <!-- question -->
                <h1 class="faq-page">Downhill vs XC vs Trail vs Enduro</h1>
                <!-- answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p></p>

                    <h4>Downhill</h4>
                    <p>Downhill racing is all about starting at the top and getting to the bottom as fast as possible. It’s one of the most thrilling and risky disciplines of mountain bike racing, with riders reaching speeds of up to 80kph and often having to clear jumps that stretch up to 19m long, or land off drops more than 3m high.</p>
                    <p class="multi-paragraph"><span class="bold"> The Bike: </span>Downhill bikes are designed specifically for riding down steep tracks, so have a specific frame shape that put the rider in the best position to do this. They are full-suspension with around 200mm of travel to allow them to ride over incredibly rough ground.</p>

                    <h4>XC</h4>
                    <p>XC is all about fitness and stamina, with cross-country race courses involving steep climbs and technical descents with features such as rock-gardens, rollers and drops. The courses aren’t as technical as downhill tracks, but riders have to exert maximum effort for the entire duration of the race.</p>

                    <p class="multi-paragraph"><span class="the-bike"> The Bike: </span>Hardtail mountain bikes with short 120mm to 130mm suspension forks, although full-suspension mountain bikes are becoming more popular. Bikes are incredibly light and efficient to maximise speed.</p>

                    <h4>Enduro</h4>
                    <p>Enduro is all about a long day (or days) out riding in a beautiful mountain location, riding up climbs and racing down technical descents.</p>
                    <p class="multi-paragraph">There are two key elements to enduro racing as a format. The first is the ‘special stage’ or ‘timed stage’; this is where the competitive action takes place. Riders are timed down these marked downhill tracks or courses, they can take anywhere between two and 20 minutes to complete and there are usually between three and six during the course of an enduro race – which are themselves one or two days long. The winner is the rider that has the lowest cumulative time; the rider who completed all the special stages in the fastest time.</p>
                    <p class="multi-paragraph">Linking these special stages are the liaisons. These are often climbs and link the end of one special stage to the start of the next. While not individually timed, each rider does have a time limit in which to reach the start of the next stage. If they are outside of this time, they are penalised.</p>
                    <p class="multi-paragraph"><span class="the-bike"> The Bike: </span>Enduro bikes are full-suspension mountain bikes with between 120 and 180mm of travel. They’ll have dropper seatposts and are designed to be durable as racers must do all trail-side repairs themselves with no outside help.</p>

             <!-- FAQ Question 4 -->
             <div class="faq-four">
                <!-- question -->
                <h1 class="faq-page">Where can I go mountain biking?</h1>
                <!-- answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>So you've got your bike, you've got your gear, but where can you use it?</p>

                    <h4>Singletrack</h4>
                    <p>This is the most common trail type. It has a width that varies from just a little wider than your shoulders on up to a track that's just wide enough for two bikes to pass. Many singletrack trails are open to one-way travel and wind their way through the best terrain that the landscape offers.</p>

                    <h4>Doubletrack</h4>
                    <p>Doubletrack trails are normally double the width (or more) of a typical singletrack trail with enough room for two bikes to ride side-by-side. Often doubletrack trails follow abandoned logging roads, fire roads or power-line roads, where the tires of vehicles created two single tracks. Doubletrack trails are usually a gentler grade than singletrack and tend to have less-technical features.</p>

                    <h4>Trail Centres</h4>
                    <p>There's something for everyone at trail centres! Trail centres have a collection of different purpose-built trails that are all graded in difficulty and various different features.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="no-bullets">Green: easy family trails</li>
                        <li class="no-bullets">Blue: moderate beginner trails: </li>
                        <li class="no-bullets">Red: intermediate trails</li>
                        <li class="no-bullets">Black: expert trails</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Bike Parks</h4>
                    <p>While trail centres are as much about climbing back up to the top as they are going down, bike parks are all about gravity. They are much more focused on going downhill and include a lot more advanced features such as larger drops and jumps.</p>

                    <h4><span class="the-bike">Bonus: </span>Pump Track</h4>
                    <p>A pump track is a short looping track consisting of whoops, rollers and bermed corners, and the idea is to ride it without pedalling. Instead, riders ‘pump’ the bike through the course using their arms and legs, gaining speed and maintaining tight control of the bike. It’s an excellent skill to perfect and can be transferred over to trail riding where it’ll give you an advantage while riding as you can generate ‘free’ speed - it’s also an incredible work out!</p>
